# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning solution to predict house prices based on a comprehensive dataset of housing features. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide accurate predictions for real estate prices, aiding buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.

## Project Overview
The House Price Prediction project focuses on creating a predictive model that estimates housing prices based on various attributes. This machine learning project encompasses the following key steps:

* **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is carefully cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. Missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features are addressed to ensure data quality.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Relevant features are selected or engineered to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. This involves exploring correlations, creating new variables, and transforming data.

* **Model Selection:** Various machine learning algorithms are considered and evaluated to identify the most suitable model for predicting house prices.

* **Model Training:** The selected model is trained on the dataset, where it learns the relationships between features and target prices.

* **Prediction and Evaluation:**  The trained model is utilized to predict house prices on unseen data. The predictions are then evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess the model's performance.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
